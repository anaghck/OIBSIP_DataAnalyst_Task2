OIBSIP_DataAnalyst_Task2 â€“ Data Cleaning on Airbnb NYC 2019

ðŸ“Œ Objective

This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset.
The aim is to prepare raw data for meaningful analysis by handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and improving data quality.
This task was completed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte under the Data Analyst domain.

ðŸ”‘ Steps Performed

Data Import & Exploration

Loaded the dataset using Pandas.

Explored dataset shape, columns, and data types.

Handling Missing Values

Identified columns with missing data.

Treated missing values using appropriate strategies (mean/median/mode or removal).

Duplicate Removal

Checked for duplicate rows.

Removed duplicates to ensure accuracy.

Data Standardization

Standardized column names for consistency.

Converted date/time columns into proper formats (if applicable).

Outlier Detection & Treatment

Used visualization (boxplots, histograms) to detect outliers.

Treated extreme values for a cleaner dataset.

Final Verification

Validated the cleaned dataset by checking descriptive statistics.

Ensured consistency and accuracy of results.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome

Successfully cleaned and preprocessed the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset.

Improved data quality by removing duplicates and handling missing values.

Standardized dataset structure for further Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & visualization.

Ensured dataset is ready for advanced insights and modeling.
